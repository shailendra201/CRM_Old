This bar chart visualizes hierarchical data using [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/). Each blue bar represents a folder, whose length encodes the total size of all files in that folder (and all subfolders). Clicking on a bar dives into that folder, while clicking on the background bubbles back up to the parent folder. The effect is similar to a [zoomable partition layout](http://bl.ocks.org/1005873), though in a more conventional display.
